## What does your project do?

### Original vision of Prescience

- Leveraging crowd wisdom to hit schelling point and find the TRUTH.

### Aim

Prescience is aimed to become a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation) for researchers, Students...  It will provide a decentralized market research platform where Researchers, Inventors and Students can get 100% objectively fair reviews, voting for their next multi-million dollar idea.
